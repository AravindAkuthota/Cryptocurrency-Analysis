# Technology Usage Plan

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed in Python utilizing dependencies including but not limited to Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, json. If we have enough time for a sentiment analysis, the Apache Hadoop software library, especially Apache Pig and MapReduce framework, will be helpful for analyzing Twitter data and NLP.

## Database Storage
We intend to use MongoDB. MongoDB is a non-relational database and therefore we do not need an ERD. We can connect to the database with PyMongo.

## Machine Learning
Google Colab will be used to run the machine learning model. The Keras library from Tensor Flow will be utilized. And we aim to use a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM) model.

## Dashboard
We will use Tableau to display graphs, charts, and try to tell a story with the data. Ideally, viewers will be able to interact through drop down menus within Tableau. If time allows, we will also incoroporate Flask. Then we can use D3.js for an interactive dashboard.
