# Technology Usage Plan

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed in Python utilizing dependencies including but not limited to Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, json. Spark for Python, aka PySpark, will be used in Google Colab. If we have enough time for a sentiment analysis, the Apache Hadoop software library, especially Apache Pig and MapReduce framework, will be helpful for analyzing Twitter data and NLP.


## Database Storage
We intend to use MongoDB. And we will integrate Flask to display the data. We will also uses the QuickDBD website to create an ERD.


## Machine Learning
Google Colab will be used to run the machine learning model. The Keras library from Tensor Flow will be utilized. And we aim to use a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM) model.

## Dashboard
In addition to using Flask, we can use D3.js for an interactive dashboard. We will also use Tableau to display graphs and tell a story with the data.
