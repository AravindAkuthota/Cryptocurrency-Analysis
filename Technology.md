# Technology Usage Plan

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Python and the Pandas library will be used to clean the data perform exploratory data analysis. The Apache Hadoop software library, especially Apache Pig and map reduce framework will also be helpful for analyzing Twitter data.


## Database Storage
MongoDB is the database we intend to use. We will integrate Flask to display the data.


## Machine Learning


## Dashboard
In addition to using Flask, we can use D3.js for an interactive dashboard. We will also use Tableau to display graphs and tell a story with the data.
