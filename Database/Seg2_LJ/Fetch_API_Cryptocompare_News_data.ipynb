       "   'body': 'MoonPay, the crypto unicorn driving NFT mania to a new high, is adding support for credit card payments to simplify purchasing non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The move follows a recent announcement from Coinbase that its upcoming NFT platform will soon add support for credit cards. Clients of MoonPay which includes a slew of celebrities from Snoop Dogg to Paris Hilton can now use the new checkout tool for buying NFTs using debit and credit cards including additional payment services via Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, Google Pay, SEPA, Faster Payments, wire transfers, open banking payments and ACH transfers. The new checkout tool supports NFT purchases across any blockchain, networks including Ethereum, Flow, Solana and Polygon. When purchasing an NFT, the gas fees will be added into the total cost of NFTs except for items linked to blockchain platforms like Polygon, for which MoonPay pays the gas fees itself. After purchasing the NFT through credit card, the token will be sent directly to a customer’s crypto wallet. For this, MoonPay charges a processing fee of 3.5% or $3.99, whichever is larger. Commenting on the development, MoonPay CEO Ivan Soto-Wright said: “Right now, the NFT market is limited to the hundreds of millions of people who own cryptocurrency. MoonPay’s NFT Checkout has just opened the door to billions more who own credit cards by making ownership both simple and fast.” “NFTs represent the future, not just of our company,...',\n",

Kusama\\xa0is a network built as a risk-taking, fast-moving ‘canary in the coal mine’ for its cousin Polkadot. Let us move ahead to read about Kusama technical analysis. Past Performance of KSM The KSM coin price shows a decline of 35% in the past week as it breaks below the crucial psychological mark of $200. The free fall approaches the $150 mark, which provided support once before in July 2021. Moreover, the lack of a single bullish engulfing candlestick in the daily chart indicates extremely weak bullish powers. KSM/USD Daily Chart KSM Technical Analysis The KSM coin price shows an 8.41% downfall in the past 24 hours with a 40% in the intraday trading volume. Therefore, the metrics indicate a rise in trend momentum that may shortly break below the $150 mark. The crucial Exponential Moving Averages achieve a bearish alignment with the recent bearish crossover of 100 and 200-day EMA. Moreover, the 50-day EMA provides dynamic resistance to multiple bullish revolts.

At a meeting on Tuesday, party officials were told to investigate the issue, which has far-reaching implications for the future. A seminar hosted by the party is expected to address the economic elements of the Metaverse, cryptocurrencies, and social media. The Metaverse is gaining popularity in Turkey.

The majority of these virtual lands are located in the historic former capital of Istanbul. According to Cointelegraph, the Turkish government recently gathered in the Metaverse to debate cryptocurrency policy. Mustafa Elitaş, leader of Turkey’s Grand National Assembly stated: “I believe that metaverse-based gatherings will be developed quickly and become a fundamental part of our life.” While the Turkish government is receptive to blockchain technology, Metaverse, and a state-issued digital currency, President Erdogan is well-known for his anti-crypto currency stance.

The move is seen as a way for the company to repay funds to its shareholders. According to the sources, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. owns around a third of the association, and a group of the association’s members owns the remaining two-thirds.

Meta announced this idea in June 2019. PayPal, Stripe, and Visa were among the founding members of the group, which also featured a long list of some of the world’s top corporations.
