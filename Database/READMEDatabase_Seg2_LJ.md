# Database
## Overview
Find public resources on virtual currencies for non-profit academic research through Kaggle and Data world. We use Pandas to narrow down the data and remove some extraneous information. The preparation of these data will effectively improve the speed and accuracy of data operations, and upload these data to MongoDB.
### Data Selection
* Remove unimportant information such as virtual currency names and symbols.
* Reduce the time horizon to nearly five years, reduce the amount of data and improve forecast accuracy.
## MongoDB
* Upload the sorted data to MongoDB, so that team members can more easily obtain the latest data.
