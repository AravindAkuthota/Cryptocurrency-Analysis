# Linear regression model
### Overview of the model
Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. Before attempting to fit a linear model to observed data,we should first determine whether or not there is a relationship between the variables of interest. 
## Data Preprocessing
* Convert timestamp to datetime, and set Date as index.
* Create the heatmap to find the correlation of each cryptocurrency.
* We remove some unnecessary data to avoid the loss of accuracy of linear regression.

## Machine learning model
In order to improve the accuracy of machine learning models, we rescale input variables using standardization or normalizaion.
